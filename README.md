# AndroidSandbox
repo for android rnd

This is a repo I created to start learning android app development.  The intent is to familiarize myself with the platform.

The general plan is to use the leagueheads webservice apis that i built to authenticate, and serve data to an android UI.

So far there is some good code here to understand how to implement http auth in an android app.
